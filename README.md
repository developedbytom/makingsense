# Making Sense

A fun little test!

The index.php file contains each step of my solution to the problem.

In order to quickly demonstrate my working for each step I commented out the previous one and continued below.

Step 1: write out proposed structure
Step 2: make for loop and check runs from 1 to 100
Step 3: added first modulo if statement
Step 4: added remaining if/else checks
Step 5: check with other values
Step 6: returned to original values and checked comments

I also made a commit for each step.

There are screenshots in the results folder for the tests from step 4 and 5 (two screenshots for each as it was too long for one screen!).

My final solution to the problem is included under all the commented out working in step 6 (though this is really the same code as in step 4!).

My only other [repo](https://github.com/developedbytom/antcrusher) up here at the moment is a C++ game for the [Arduboy](https://arduboy.com) I was working on a few weeks ago which is mostly using for loops to spawn waves of ants and drawing repeating wall tiles.
